      q: 'Can I export directly from OneNote to Anki?',
      a: "Not directly — OneNote has no Anki export. Export the page to PDF or Word first, then upload that file to 2anki to get an Anki deck. It's one extra step and takes a few seconds in OneNote's File menu.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Should I export as PDF or Word?',
      a: "Either works. Word (.docx) tends to preserve headings and lists more reliably, which gives cleaner card splits. PDF is fine when Word export isn't available. Try Word first if your page has clear headings.",
    },
    {
      q: 'How do my OneNote headings become cards?',
      a: "Each heading becomes the front of a card and the text beneath it becomes the back. Pages you've structured with headings and short sections convert into the most useful decks; unstructured pages give the converter less to work with.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Will my handwritten OneNote notes convert?',
      a: "No. Ink and handwriting export as images, not text, so the words can't be read into cards. Only typed text converts. If your notes are handwritten, the OneNote page won't produce readable card content.",
    },
    {
      q: 'What file do I get back?',
      a: 'An .apkg file. Open it in Anki on desktop or mobile, or sync it through AnkiWeb. No manual card entry — the deck is ready to study.',

      q: 'Will images from my Evernote notes come across?',

    },
    {
      q: 'Why did my note become one card instead of many?',
      a: "Cards come from structure. A note that's one long block of prose has no front/back split to work from. Break it into headings and lists, write Q: and A: lines, or use the AI mode to generate question-and-answer cards from the text.",
