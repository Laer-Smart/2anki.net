    {
      q: 'Can it produce image occlusion cards?',
      a: "Image occlusion is a native Anki feature built into the card editor — it's not something 2anki builds during conversion. What 2anki does is bring your diagrams across as images. Open the resulting deck in Anki, select an image card, and use Anki's image occlusion tool to add the masks.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Can it handle a full course of slides?',
      a: "Yes. Upload one block at a time — one module, one week, one organ system — rather than an entire year's worth of slides in one file. Anki handles 500-card decks far better than 5,000-card ones, and smaller decks are easier to schedule and share.",
    },
    {
      q: 'How is this different from Quizlet?',
      a: 'Anki uses a spaced repetition algorithm that schedules each card based on how well you remembered it, so high-yield cards you struggle with come back sooner. Quizlet offers flash-card practice but does not schedule cards the same way. If your program or study group uses Anki, 2anki keeps your decks in the same ecosystem.',
