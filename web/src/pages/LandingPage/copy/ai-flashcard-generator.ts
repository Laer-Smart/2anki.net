    'AI flashcard generator for Anki — your notes in, real cards out | 2anki',

    'Turn your own notes into Anki cards. 2anki reads what you upload and builds a deck — no hallucinated cards, no invented facts.',

      q: 'What does the AI actually do?',
      a: 'The study chat turns text you type or paste into question-and-answer cards. It works from your material — your notes, your definitions, your summary — not from a topic name. Upload conversion is separate and deterministic: it reads the text in your file and lays out cards from it.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can it generate a deck from a topic on its own?',
      a: "No. We don't invent flashcards or read your images. If you ask it for cards on a subject with no notes, it has nothing to work from. Give it your material and it turns that into cards you can trust.",
    },
    {
      q: 'How do I use the study chat?',
      a: 'Sign in and open the chat. The free tier covers 20 messages a month; paste your notes and it returns cards you can refine. Conversion from a file — PDF, PowerPoint, Notion, Markdown — has no message cap.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why notes-first instead of a one-click generator?',
      a: 'Cards built from your own notes match what you studied, so spaced repetition reinforces the real material instead of plausible-sounding filler. That fidelity is the point.',
