      q: 'Do scanned PDFs work?',

      q: 'Can it produce image occlusion cards?',
      a: "Image occlusion is a native Anki feature built into the card editor. 2anki brings your diagrams across as images; you then open the resulting deck in Anki and use Anki's image occlusion tool to add label masks to anatomy illustrations.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Can it handle a full semester of nursing slides?',
      a: 'Yes. Upload one module or one topic at a time rather than the whole semester in one file. Smaller decks are easier to schedule, easier to review, and Anki handles 500-card decks more smoothly than 5,000-card ones.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How is this different from Quizlet?',
      a: 'Anki uses spaced repetition to schedule each card based on your recall — cards you find harder come back sooner. Quizlet offers flash-card practice but schedules differently. Many nursing programs and study groups coordinate around Anki decks, so 2anki keeps your cards in the same ecosystem.',
