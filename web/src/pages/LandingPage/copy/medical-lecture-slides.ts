    {
      q: 'Do scanned PDFs work?',
      a: 'Only if the scan has a text layer from OCR. PDFs exported from PowerPoint or Keynote always have a text layer. If you photographed paper handouts, run them through an OCR tool first — macOS Preview and Adobe Acrobat both do this.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can it produce image occlusion cards?',
      a: "Image occlusion is a native Anki feature built into the card editor — 2anki doesn't build the masks during conversion. 2anki brings your diagrams across as images. Open the resulting deck in Anki and use Anki's image occlusion tool to add label masks to any diagram.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Can it handle a full course of slides?',
      a: 'Yes. Upload one lecture or one topic block at a time rather than an entire course as a single file. Smaller decks are easier to schedule and review, and Anki performs better with focused 200–500 card decks than with one massive deck.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How is this different from Quizlet?',
      a: 'Anki uses a spaced repetition algorithm that schedules each card based on your recall, so cards you find harder come back sooner. Quizlet offers flash-card practice but uses a different scheduling model. If your program or study group uses Anki, 2anki keeps your lecture notes in the same ecosystem.',
