    {
      q: 'Will it read scanned PDFs?',
      a: 'Only if the scan has a text layer (OCR). Most modern textbooks and slide exports do. If yours is a photo of a page with no text layer, run it through an OCR tool first — macOS Preview and Adobe Acrobat both do this.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does it pick what becomes a card?',
      a: "Headings become deck and tag names. Bullet points and short paragraphs become card fronts; the next line or indent becomes the back. You can edit the cards in Anki after — we don't lock anything down.",
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I upload a whole textbook?',
      a: 'Yes, but big PDFs take longer and can create huge decks. We recommend uploading one chapter at a time — easier to review, easier to share, and Anki handles 500-card decks better than 50,000-card ones.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What about diagrams and equations?',
      a: 'Diagrams come across as embedded images. Equations rendered as images stay images; equations stored as text need MathJax enabled in your Anki card template to display.',
