title: Overlapping cloze
description: Turn a list or a paragraph into a set of cards that hide one item at a time.
---

When you're memorizing an ordered sequence — the steps of a process, the cranial nerves, the lines of a poem — you want to drill it line by line: hide one item, recall it with the surrounding lines in view, then move to the next. Overlapping cloze turns a single list into exactly that set of cards.

Each card hides one item with a cloze deletion. One cloze per card, so Anki schedules each line on its own — no waiting a day between siblings.

## Turn it on

1. Open **Card options**.
2. Under **Card types**, turn on **Cloze deletion cards**.
3. In **Overlapping cloze**, pick a style.

The picker stays disabled until Cloze is on.

## The two styles

Say you have a Notion toggle titled **Pledge of Allegiance** whose contents are a bulleted list:

- I pledge allegiance
- to the flag
- of the United States of America
- and to the republic for which it stands

A list of 4 items becomes 4 cards. The styles differ in how much of the list each card shows around the hidden line.

A five-line list, cycling through its cards:

**Show the whole list**

<overlapping-cloze-demo data-style="show-all"></overlapping-cloze-demo>

**Show nearby lines only**

<overlapping-cloze-demo data-style="windowed"></overlapping-cloze-demo>

**Show the whole list** keeps every line visible, hiding one at a time. The card for the third line reads:

> I pledge allegiance
> to the flag
> [...]
> and to the republic for which it stands

**Show nearby lines only** keeps just the line before and the line after, dropping the rest. The card for the third line reads:

> to the flag
> [...]
> and to the republic for which it stands

The first line is gone — you recall the hidden line from its immediate neighbours, not the whole list. Show the whole list is best when the full sequence jogs your memory; show nearby lines only is closer to true recitation.

## Works on a single paragraph too

If a page is one paragraph or quote instead of a list, overlapping cloze splits it for you. A few sentences become one card per sentence; a single sentence with commas becomes one card per clause. Surrounding quote marks and guillemets are stripped first.

A quote like «You should not bother others, you should be kind, and otherwise do as you like» becomes 3 cards, each hiding one clause.

The same goes for a song or poem whose lines sit in separate blocks — each line becomes its own card.

## What fires it

Overlapping cloze fires when a card's answer is a list of 2 or more items, or when a page is a single paragraph that splits into 2 or more sentences or clauses. A single item or clause becomes one normal cloze card. Other cards are untouched.

This includes Word documents. A .docx section — a heading followed by a bullet list — normally converts to one card with the whole list on the back. With overlapping cloze on, that list fans out into one card per bullet instead.

The result is a standard Cloze deck — it downloads, syncs, and studies like any other.
