title: MCP connector
description: The hosted 2anki MCP server — tools, limits, and how it authenticates.
---

2anki runs a hosted MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, so AI assistants can build Anki decks on your account. Connect it once and ask for flashcards from inside a conversation — the assistant calls 2anki and returns a download link for a ready `.apkg`.

**Server URL:** `https://2anki.net/mcp`

For step-by-step connection instructions for Claude and ChatGPT, see [Use 2anki inside Claude or ChatGPT](/documentation/start-here/use-in-claude). The connector is open to every signed-in account — no request needed.

| `list_my_decks`     | List the decks on your account                                                   |

## Authentication

The server uses OAuth 2.1. The first time an assistant connects, 2anki opens a sign-in and consent screen; approve it once and the connection persists. Revoke it any time by removing the connector in the assistant's settings.

## Limits

Conversions through MCP count against the same plan limits as the web app: free accounts have a monthly card limit and a photo quota; paid plans convert without limits. Individual requests are capped at 5 MB of text, 500 cards per deck, and 10 MB per photo.
