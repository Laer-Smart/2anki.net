# This script is NOT wired into the automated deploy yet. Run it manually for
# the dry-run and staged prod validation described in the doc. It assumes the
# repo is already built (`pnpm build`) and GIT_SHA is exported.
#
# Set DRY_RUN=1 to print every privileged/destructive action instead of running
# it (used for the local docker / staging dry-run).
