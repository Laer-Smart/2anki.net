description: Parallel server tsc + server arch + web typecheck + web vitest + web lint
allowed-tools: Bash
---

Run all checks in parallel via a single Bash call:

```bash
pnpm --filter notion2anki-server build & \
pnpm --filter notion2anki-server arch & \
pnpm --filter 2anki-web typecheck & \
pnpm --filter 2anki-web test:run & \
pnpm --filter 2anki-web lint & \
wait
```

`arch` is the dependency-cruiser architecture-fitness sensor (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs`). It exits non-zero only on `error`-severity rules — today that is one: a value-import of the knex query builder outside `src/data_layer/`. Circular-dependency, data-layer-leaf, and layer-skip (route/controller reaching `data_layer` directly) violations ride as `warn` (reported, non-blocking) — they document existing debt that should shrink, not grow.

If any fails, print one line per failure with the file:line and the error message — nothing else. If all pass, say "all clean" and stop.

The web `lint` step runs oxlint with the rules that mirror SonarCloud findings (`typescript/prefer-optional-chain`, `no-nested-ternary`, `unicorn/no-negated-condition`, `no-unneeded-ternary`). Catching them locally avoids a CI round-trip after Sonar comments on a PR.
